## My FOSS Story

- Started with tiny shell scripts in college
  - Then vim, tmux, zsh, themes, ricing
  - Ended up maintaining dotfiles - almost 8 years now, 1000+ commits
- Built tools to make my own learning and dev life easier
- Accidentally fell into open source
- People noticed, used, contributed back

## Small Projects, Big Ripples

Consistent value delivery wins over perfection

- A couple of lua files → conference invite
- A late night blog post → 100s of weekly visits
- A poorly edited youtube video → collaboration offers

## Why Developer Tools?

Goal: Keep my dev environment efficient and fun

- Because I am selfish
  - I build what I wish existed for me
  - I use what I build every day

- It directly contributes to my productivity

## Behind the Scenes

- Ideation: Scratch your own itch
- Prototyping: Get something working, ugly is fine
- Polishing: Refine, test, refactor
- Publishing: Always write docs early, not late
- Maintenance: Deal with issues gracefully
- Community: Respond, learn, and evolve

## What FOSS Taught Me

- Technical depth through real-world problems
- Creativity through constraints
- Networking without networking

- How to build real software
  - Backwards compatibility
  - Third party integrations and dependencies
  - Documentation
  - Releases

## The Human Side of Open Source

- FOSS = code + people + persistence
- You’ll find mentors, collaborators, friends
- It’s self-expression in code form
- It’s your portfolio, reputation, and playground

## Why You Should Contribute

- Learn faster than any course or job
- Build credibility in public
- Make global impact from your laptop
- Unlock career opportunities organically

## How to Start Today

- What do you want in the world that doesn’t exist yet?
  - could be something new
  - could be an improvement to something existing
- Write about what you build
- Contribute docs, tests, or issues
- Don’t wait for permission — start small, stay consistent

## Warnings & What _Not_ to Do

- Don’t take feedback personally
- Don’t chase stars — chase usefulness
- Don't focus on quantity - optimize for quality
- Don’t compare your beginning to someone’s middle
- Avoid perfection paralysis — “done” beats “perfect”
- Remember: open source should _energize_, not _drain_ you
