## My FOSS Story

- Started with tiny shell scripts in college
- Built tools to make my own dev life easier
- Accidentally fell into open source
- 8 years later: plugins, talks, and a Tokyo trip!

## From Personal to Public

- “Scratching my own itch” turned into useful tools
- Shared on GitHub → feedback → improvements
- Realized other had the same pain points
- Growth happened _after_ I hit “Publish”

## Small Projects, Big Ripples

- A 20-line script → 100s of weekly visits
- A blog post → conference invite
- Consistency beats complexity every single time

## Building Developer Tools

- Developer tools are like invisible infrastructure
- Goal: make devs faster, smarter, happier
- Core principles I follow:
  - Minimal friction
  - Optimized for DX
  - Fast feedback loops

## Behind the Scenes

- Ideation: scratch your own itch
- Prototyping: get something working, ugly is fine
- Publishing: write docs early, not late
- Maintenance: deal with issues gracefully
- Community: respond, learn, and evolve

## What FOSS Taught Me

- Technical depth through real-world problems
- Creativity through constraints
- Networking without networking
- Feedback is your best teacher
- Contribution is a long-term game

## The Human Side of Open Source

- FOSS = code + people + persistence
- You’ll find mentors, collaborators, friends
- It’s self-expression in code form
- It’s your portfolio, reputation, and playground

## Why You Should Contribute

- Learn faster than any course or job
- Build credibility in public
- Make global impact from your laptop
- Unlock career opportunities organically

<!-- end_slide -->

## How to Start Today

- Find your pain points → automate them
- Write about what you build
- Contribute docs, tests, or issues
- Don’t wait for permission — start small, stay consistent

<!-- jump_to_middle -->

## Warnings & What _Not_ to Do

- Don’t chase stars — chase usefulness
- Don’t burn out maintaining everything yourself
- Don’t take feedback personally
- Avoid perfection paralysis — “done” beats “perfect”
- Don’t compare your beginning to someone’s middle
- Remember: open source should _energize_, not _drain_ you

## Key Takeaways

- You don’t need permission to contribute
- Curiosity > Credentials
- Consistency > Complexity
- FOSS is both career and canvas
